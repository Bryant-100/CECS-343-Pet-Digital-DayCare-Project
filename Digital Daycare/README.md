Features:

Login
-- Create/Delete account
Note:
- unique username, no password
- user navigate between accounts freely

Pet 
-- Add/remove pet
NOTE:
- pet's status is based on the COMPLETION PERCENTAGE of the current TOTAL TASK (MEANT TO BE REFRESHED DAILY)

Activities
-- add/remove task
-- mark complete/incomplete
NOTE:
- the idea here is for tasks to be a reminder, not a one-off completion task (hence renamed to activity)
- the addition/removal is expected to be rare; while marking completion or undoing is the purpose of the program

Event (previously Challenge)
-- ONE-TIME effect DAILY on status; status can either increase/decrease/neutral (Details on probability in event.py)
-- This feature is simplified due to vague requirements and uncertainty on implementation
