## AccountManager:
ACC_FILENAME = "users.csv"
-- ^^ constant string that allows us to easily change csv filename if desired
-- logout() is currently empty
--- I decided to keep id just in case, the whole password thing is too much given our current manpower

## Account:
PETS_FILENAME = "pets.csv"
-- represent the user object we will be using
